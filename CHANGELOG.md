## v50.0.0-beta.5 — Exp Decay Easing Consolidation (Current Beta)

cosmostrix v50.0.0-beta.5 — masterclass easing consolidation. All **temporal** easing in the rain simulation now uses the unified **exponential decay** family. Owner-approved, owner-verified feel. 227 source files, ~89K LOC, ~1500+ tests pass (1656/0/2 — 4 new regression tests added).

### What's new since beta.4

- **Pause/resume → exp decay** (commit `e2e0512`): replaced the prior smootherstep S-curve (6t⁵-15t⁴+10t³ over fixed 0.30s decel / 0.45s resume) with asymmetric exponential decay — `exp(-k·t)` decel (k=1.2/s, settle 5% @ ~2.5s) + `1 - exp(-k·t)` accel (k=0.9/s, settle 95% @ ~3.3s). The asymmetric k_decel > k_resume preserves the prior "pause snappy / resume wake-up" feel. Settle thresholds snap to clean terminal state so other subsystems (spawn_remainder reset, monolith stream shift, phosphor LUT) see unambiguous transitions. Restores the README's previously-stale "exponential deceleration (~3s coast-down)" promise (smootherstep is not exponential — the README was wrong under the prior implementation).
- **Glyph scene entry → exp decay** (this beta): migrated the scene-entry ramp from smoothstep (3t²-2t³ over 700ms) to the same exp approach family — `1 - exp(-k·t)` with k=4.28/s (derived so settle 95% lands at the documented 700ms). Now all temporal easing in the rain path uses the same physical-drag model — pause, resume, and scene entry all coast under the same math primitive. exp() was already in use in the cosmic locked path (`cloud/phosphor.rs:307` LUT build) and chroma shaders/base LUT (`shaders/base/mod.rs:237`), so no new math primitive introduced.
- **Defensive invariant** (`debug_assert!` in `rain_at`): pause_start and resume_start cannot coexist — toggle_pause() guarantees this across all 3 branches (start-decel / abort-decel / unpause-from-paused), now asserted at the rain entry point. Zero-cost in release builds.
- **4 new regression tests** in `cloud/tests/mod.rs`: pause decel settle at 5% threshold, resume accel settle at 95% threshold, glyph entry ramp settle at 700ms + k derivation sanity-check, and the audit §8.6 invariant (pause_start + resume_start never coexist across all 3 toggle branches). Locks the masterclass easing contract — any future regression to a different curve or threshold fails CI.
- **Unified easing design doc** in `central_control_rains/mod.rs`: a new "Easing family policy" section documents which easings are exp decay (pause/resume + glyph entry) vs smoothstep (spatial fades — edge fade, vignette, brightness bands) vs intentional smoothstep-shaped rate (profile interpolation's 30s slow-drift morph) vs linear (chroma 3-row color transition falloff). Prevents future contributors from "consolidating" the wrong easings and breaking the intentional design.

### Files changed

- `src/cosmic_dragon_engine/cloud/rain.rs` — decel + accel + glyph entry ramp blocks; new `debug_assert!`; comment updates
- `src/cosmic_dragon_engine/cloud/tests/mod.rs` — 4 new regression tests + 1 existing test comment/duration bump
- `src/cosmic_dragon_engine/cloud/spawn.rs` — doc-comment updates for the new glyph entry ramp math
- `src/central_control_rains/mod.rs` — new glyph entry constants block + unified easing policy doc section
- `README.md` — pause/resume bullet expanded to mention unified family + glyph entry
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this entry
- `src/cosmic_dragon_engine/KEY.md` + `RULES.md` — UNLOCK entry (rain.rs + spawn.rs + tests are locked path)

### What is NOT exp decay (intentionally, documented)

- **Spatial fades** (edge fade, vignette, brightness bands) stay smoothstep — they're position-based, not time-based. The "blend" parameter is a cell's row/col, not elapsed time.
- **Profile interpolation** (30s slow-drift morph) keeps the smoothstep-shaped per-frame lerp rate — its "slow drift then accelerate then snap" feel is intentionally different from exp approach's "fast start then settle" feel.
- **Chroma color transition falloff** (3-row spatial window) stays linear — smoothstep was deliberately rejected as overkill.
- **Intro logo Phase 3 fade** stays smoothstep — intro animation, not pause/resume lifecycle.

### Lock status

- Cosmic Dragon: re-locked after this commit (UNLOCK entry in `cosmic_dragon_engine/KEY.md` + `RULES.md`)
- Chroma Dragon: untouched (no chroma paths modified)
- Crystal Dragon: untouched

## v50.0.0-beta.4 — Three Dragon Engines

cosmostrix v50.0.0-beta.4 — production-LTS-grade stability after full audit pass. 226 source files, ~89K LOC, ~1500+ tests pass. All 3 dragon engines locked with A/B benchmark signature.

### What's new since beta.3

- **Live-reload masterclass** (Option D): message, message-border, msg-mode, intro-color now live-reload. CLI intent guards for power-dragon, async-mode, monolith-size, color-tune. color.tune reset-on-comment bug fixed.
- **New CLI flags**: `--intro-color`, `--power-dragon`, `--msg-mode`, `--crystal-dragon`, `--async-mode` (all `<true|false>` or `<name>` with value_parser — no silent-toggle).
- **`--uniform` removed** → replaced by `--async-mode false`. `--check-updated` alias removed → `--check-update` is canonical.
- **Verbose honesty**: "final runtime state" section now tracks ALL live-reload fields (12 total) — shows EFFECTIVE runtime values, not startup values.
- **Border gradient fix**: triangle wave eliminates sharp white→black gap on left border. All color output routes through Chroma Dragon (routing rule codified).
- **Disclaimer injector**: auto-injects "source code = truth" disclaimer to all `*.md` files. Wired into gate-keepers.sh.
- **Dynamic default message**: `"cosmostrix v<CARGO_PKG_VERSION>"` — version from Cargo.toml at compile time, never hardcoded.
- **Did-you-mean**: strengthened for all 5 new CLI flags + `--intro-color` hard error for unknown themes (was silent ignore).

## v50.0.0-beta.3 — Three Dragon Engines

cosmostrix v50 is the "zero to hero" culmination — from a simple terminal rain demo to a professional-grade cinematic renderer with three independent dragon engines, each owning a distinct concern. 220+ source files, ~89K LOC, ~1500+ tests pass.

### The Three Dragon Engines

- **Cosmic Dragon** (`src/cosmic_dragon_engine/`) — Simulation core. Droplet lifecycle, spawn physics, atmospheric evolution, cinematic behaviors, self-healer, phase predictor, reclaim state. Never touches palette.
- **Chroma Dragon** (`src/chroma_dragon_engine/`) — Coloring engine. OKLab gradient palettes, per-cell shader pipeline, climate post-FX (luminance/saturation/hue drift), L-smoothing, 300ms top-to-bottom wave transitions on every color-change path.
- **Crystal Dragon** (`src/crystal_dragon_engine/`) — Ambient intelligence. CPU/CLOCK-driven palette drift (44 themes in Cold/Medium/Hot groups, probabilistic weighted selection, 60s polling, 12% drift chance, 60s dwell hysteresis). Time-of-day ambient scheduler for automatic scene+palette switching via `config.toml`.

### Highlights Since v13

- Module-directory source layout (12 module dirs), extracted from flat `src/`.
- MSRV 1.97, Clippy `-D warnings` CI gate, Miri nightly validation.
- PGO (Profile-Guided Optimization) two-stage build via `./scripts/build.sh pgo`.
- Fat LTO, single codegen-unit release profile with platform-specific PGO profiles.
- Live config reload with SHA-512 fingerprinting and OKLab smooth transitions.
- Central Control Dragon Power: thermal sampling, endurance health, power management.
- Terminal protocol detection (kitty, wezterm, alacritty, iTerm2, Windows Terminal, tmux).
- Synchronized output (`ESC`) for tear-free frame delivery.
- 18 scenes: monolith (default), matrix, signal, classic, cinematic, calm, storm, cosmos, neon, hacker, matrix_film, low-power, cosmic-dragon, carbonic, dragon-crystal, orange-cat, north-stars, curiosity.
- 44+ builtin color themes with OKLab gradients and climate post-FX.
- `--doctor` diagnostics, `--benchmark` with JSON output, `--testconf` validation.
- Cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, Android. AUR package: `cosmostrix-bin`.

### Interactive Controls

`q` quit · `Space` reset animation + restart message typewriter · `c`/`C` cycle colors · `s`/`S` cycle charsets · `x` cycle scene forward (`X` no-op) · `p` pause/resume · `i` toggle HUD (`I` no-op) · `[`/`]` adjust density · `Up`/`Down` adjust speed

## Pre-v13 Era — The Journey From v2 to v12

These releases are documented in detail in [`docs/archive/CHANGELOG_PRE_V13.md`](docs/archive/CHANGELOG_PRE_V13.md). The summary below captures the arc.

### v12.0.0 — Protocol Engine

Terminal protocol detection (kitty keyboard, synchronized output, in-band resize reports). Render path respects each terminal's capabilities instead of falling back to lowest-common-denominator.

### v11.x — Cinematic Peak & Benchmark Depth

- v11.1.0: Benchmark reaches S-tier — RSS memory tracking, p99.9 / max frame-time metrics, sub-component timing (sim/render/io), JSON output mode, live HUD overlay. Theme tuning makes the 43 builtin palettes visually distinct.
- v11.0.0: Cinematic peak. Smoothstep easing on pause/resume, top-to-bottom wave color transitions, mouse-click effects, bracketed-paste safety.

### v10.0.0 — Peak Performance & Stability

Diff-based cell renderer reaches steady state. All known frame-time regressions resolved. Long-run soak tests (10h+) confirm zero leaks in memory, FDs, threads, CPU.

### v5.0.0 — Nightfall

Visual identity overhaul. TrueColor gradients become the default on capable terminals; ANSI 256-color mode remains as a fallback. CRT phosphor decay model replaced with physics-based exponential curve.

### v4.x — Atmosphere Polish

Iterative atmosphere work across v4.5–v4.9: fog vignette tuning, parallax brightness calibration, head self-bloom, climate luminance/saturation minimums, profile luminance offsets. Each release raised the visual floor without changing the architecture from v4.0.0.

### v3.x — The Foundational Era

- v3.9.0: ground-work for v4 (above).
- v3.1.0: first appearance of droplet physics and the rain-style lifecycle.
- v3.0.0: initial public release — basic rain rendering, single color, no scenes, no profiles.

### v2.x — Soak & Stability

- v2.1.0: visual contrast & readability overhaul — readable body glyphs, depth-layer visibility, CRT afterglow, pause/resume easing, mouse mode default-off, safe terminal cleanup on all exit paths.
- v2.0.0: first public-stability release. Stale glyph artifacts fixed, long-idle resync, direct-color auto-detection for `xterm-direct` / `tmux-direct`. 10h+ visual soak checks confirmed no leaks.
